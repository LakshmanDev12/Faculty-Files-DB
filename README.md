Integrated Faculty Management Portal is a structured system that manages faculty details, departments, and course assignments. It supports SQL operations like joins, aggregate queries, stored procedures, and exception-handling functions. Faculty can be linked with departments and courses, with workload tracking using aggregate functions. The portal is integrated with PHP and PostgreSQL for real-time interaction and data management.
